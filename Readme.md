# Usage

Server Side Rendering is difficult and is not worth the frontend code rewrite for small teams. `ssrize` is the easiest tool to turn your existing React, Angular or other Single-Page Applications into server-side rendered apps.

Install the package using NPM:

```
npm install -g ssrize
```

or using Yarn:

```
yarn global add ssrize
```

Once `ssrize` is installed, you can run the command:

```
ssrize . -port 5000
```
