# SSRize

Server Side Rendering is difficult and is not worth the frontend code rewrite for small teams. `ssrize` is the easiest tool to turn your existing React, Angular, or other Single-Page Applications into server-side rendered apps.

# Usage

Install the package using NPM:

```shell
npm install -g ssrize
```

or using Yarn:

```shell
yarn global add ssrize
```

Once `ssrize` is installed, you can run the command:

```shell
# ssrize [dist folder] -p [port]
ssrize . -p 5000
```

# Contribution

`ssrize` is open for collaboration. Feel free to open pull requests/issues to improve this tool.
